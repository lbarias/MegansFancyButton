This is Megan's Fancy Button.
This button draws cats as the yarn button in the middle is interacted with.
	Since Megan, the client, has a love for creating art the button lets you interact with it
	faking a sensation of creatin art. The cats also represent some of Megan's likings such as
	Asian food, music - in particular obscure EDM music, and photography. The yarn button is also
	in Megan's favourite colour: Burgundy.

How it works:
click on the yarn to draw CameraCat
click on yarn and move the mouse away from the yarn (while still holding down the mouse) to draw EDMCat
click on yarn and move mousewheel (while still holding down the mouse) to draw NoodleCat.

You will know the cats are done being drawn when a sound effect starts to play. Once the cats are all
done being drawn, the cats will do a little dance to yet another EDM sound effect.
